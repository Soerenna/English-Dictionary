# English-Dictionary

This program will accept words and return their meaning or suggest alternatives if it doesn't know.

For now the program will execute in the command line but I might develope it further in the future by adding a GUI.

learning points:

    - What JSON files are and how to parse them with python
    - How to efficiently order dictionaries by their values
    - using the %%timeit magic function in jupyter notebooks
    - how to deal with minor race condition between two streams by using time.sleep()
